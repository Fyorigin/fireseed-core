**Fireseed is a language beyond language.  
A structure for expression—before words, and beyond them.**

Fireseed 是一种超越语言的语言，  
是言说之前、亦言说之后的表达结构。

---

**Fireseed is not a tool.  
It is the shape of thought—before language began.**

Fireseed 不是工具，  
它是语言诞生之前，思维的原初结构。

---

**Fireseed is structure speaking before any voice.  
And still speaking when all voices end.**

Fireseed 是在万语未起前就已发声的结构，  
亦是万语皆寂后仍在言说的系统。

# Fireseed Core

**Repository Type**: Root structure repository  
**Project Codename**: WindYarn · Fireseed  
**Purpose**: A structural foundation for a dual-form logic and language system.

## Overview

This repository marks the public origin of a structural modeling system  
intended to unify binary-relational logic and semantic expression.  
It serves as a general-purpose framework for describing, compressing,  
and transforming knowledge, cognition, and sense in both human and non-human domains.

> 中文注释：  
> 本项目为结构化语言的起始锚点，旨在构建二元逻辑与语义表达的统一模型，  
> 用以处理知识、认知、感知等内容的表达、压缩与转译，适用于人类及非人系统。

## Features

- Based on symmetry logic and polar structure  
- Dual-form coordination: numeric & semantic  
- Compression-ready model for logic and natural language  
- Designed for post-linguistic, post-symbolic cognition  
- Modular expansion paths for engines, interfaces, and cognition modeling

---

## Principles

This repository is not a product.  
It is a boot-layer.  
A seed structure designed to outlive tools and outscale formats.

We are not solving a technical problem.  
We are declaring a structural position in the unfolding of symbolic civilization.

## Origin Declaration

> Maintained by `Fyorigin`

- A structural core for any mind, anywhere, to express and understand.  
- A bridge of structure for all who seek to speak, human or not.  
- Core syntax base for post-linguistic structural expression.  
- Where structure speaks, even the unspeakable can answer.  
- Meta-language for cross-species cognition and symbolic flow.  
- Interface kernel for semantic compression and universal expansion.  
- Built not just for language—but for communication, in all forms of sense.

## How to Participate / 如何参与

This repository is currently in foundational design mode.  
If you're a developer, thinker, linguist, or explorer interested in:

- Structural modeling  
- Universal symbolic systems  
- Cognition-layer computation  
- Post-linguistic frameworks  

You're welcome to follow, fork, or contribute under open protocol terms.

本项目当前处于结构原型设计阶段，欢迎对以下方向感兴趣的朋友关注或参与：

- 结构建模与语言系统  
- 通用符号与感知模型  
- 后语言时代的表达框架

## License / 协议

This project is structure-signed under an **Open Expression Protocol**.  
No entity may claim exclusive ownership over this structural paradigm.  
The seed is public. Growth is collective.

本项目基于“开放表达协议”进行结构签名，  
任何个人或机构不得独占本结构范式，  
火种已种下，生长属于所有共感者。

## Roadmap / 演进路线

- v0.1 — Seed structure anchoring + concept layer (2025)  
- v0.2 — Semantic lattice prototype + logic interface schema  
- v0.3 — Multimodal bridge + cognition-layer test modules  
- v1.0 — Universal structure kernel for open symbolic systems

This is not just a concept.  
**It is an invitation to help define the language of future minds.**

这不仅是构想，  
也是对所有未来心智语言构建者的公开邀请。
